DESCRIPTION:
ELEKTRA MD Electric Underfloor Heating Mats are a premium solution, featuring a thin heating cabled stitched securely to a sticky self adhesive back glass fibre mesh for quick and easy installation.

ELEKTRA 100w MD Underfloor Heating Mat Kits are the most innovative heating systems in the industry that can serve as a secondary heat source, taking the chill off of floor tiles. With radiant heating, almost any floor covering and any room type can be heated effectively, including bathrooms and ensuites. ELEKTRA heating mat cables are evenly spaced out to provide an even heat distribution across the floor to suit the required heat output. Please note; all electrical connections must be undertaken by a qualified electrician.

Running costs and heat up times can be reduced by up to 25% with the use of Ekoboard XPS insulation Boards or Thermopanel Tile Backer Boards.

*Please note - Mats over 10m2 will consist of 2no. heating mats. Up to 34m2 can be installed on a 16 amp thermostat.

Each Mat Measures 500mm Wide - Ending in a 4m Cold Tail Supply Cable
Self-Adhesive Fibre Mesh for Easy Installation

Lifetime Guarantee with UK Based Technical Support

Elektra MD Electric Underfloor Heating Mats include flexible conduits and a complete easy to read installation guide booklet and DVD. Uheat recommends using a flexible self-levelling compound or a flexible tile adhesive, with a 6-8mm covering to install the mats.

A Lifetime Guarantee is available for ELEKTRA MD Underfloor Heating Mats, and UK based technical support for the installation / operation of the underfloor heating is provided by Uheat Underfloor Heating's experience and qualified technicians.

About Elektra Heatmats:
Manufactured in Europe complying with ISO 9001 using the highest quality raw materials, in accordance with IEC EN 60335-2-96. Elektra electric underfloor heating mats have gained many approvals around the world, including the German VDE - probably the highest standard in Europe.

CE Certified
Lifetime Guarantee is available for Elektra MD Underfloor heating mats and UK based technical support for the installation / operating of the underfloor heating is provided by our experienced & qualified technicians.

Notes:
Insulation is optional underneath the heating mats but it will reduce the warmup time and reduce running costs so it should always be used if possible. We recommend using EKOBOARD XPS Insulation or Thermopanel Tile Backer Boards.

If the floor finish is tiles, you can either use flexible tile adhesive directly on the mat or self -level over the heating mat then fix the tiles with flexible tile adhesive.

If you're going to use MD heating mats under wood, vinyl or carpet, then you will need to use a self levelling compound over the mat before installing the floor finish.
